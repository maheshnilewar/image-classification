  - `phase_1_2.ipynb`: Data exploration and baseline models
  - `phase_3.ipynb`: Neural network experiments (PyTorch)
  - `phase_4.ipynb`: Advanced CNN architectures
- `results/figures/`: Training curves and confusion matrices
- `results/metrics/`: Classification reports

## Dataset
TinyImageNet-100 (excluded from repo due to size)

## Results
See `results/` for model performance visualizations and metrics.
